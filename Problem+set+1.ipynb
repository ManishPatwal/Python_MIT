    "# Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Summer is high season for tourism in Boston: tens of thousands of tourists visit the city's historical landmarks. Many visitors take guided tours around Boston and Cambridge in trolleys, double-deck buses and even amphibian boat-buses. Many of these guided tours make a stop at MIT, in a place called Kendall Square. The thousands of tourists that stop in Kendall every summer, usually thirsty, are a great market for cold bottled water.\n",
    "\n",
    "A local store based in Kendall takes advantage of this opportunity by placing dozens of water bottles in huge blue buckets with iced in the shade, within sight of the tourists. The colder the water bottles are, the better they sell. It takes usually several hours to chill the bottles, so the decision of how many bottles to prepare for sale is taken the previous day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been asked by a local Kendall store to help them calculate the number of water bottles they should chill and stock in the ice buckets, ready to sell to tourists each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on historical data, you have determined the daily demand for bottled water in Kendall during the summer is – on average – normally distributed with a mean of 400 bottles, with a standard deviation of 100 bottles. The store buys the water bottles at 55 cents a piece, and spends an additional 10 cents in electricity and ice to chill it and keep it that way. A chilled bottle is sold to the tourists at 1 dollar a piece. Since the labels of the bottles deteriorate under water, the bottles that do not sell at the end of the day have to be discarded at a loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a code to determine how many water bottles the store should prepare for sale every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You might consider using Python package scipy.stats to calculate the value of k."
