    "- dc: distribution center id\n",
    "- sku: SKU id\n",

    "- Concatenate the 2 inventory datasets to create a single dataset. The resulting DataFrame should contain 118,650 rows\n",
    "- Sort the values by DC, SKU and Date in ascending order\n",
    "- Identify how many unique distribution centers are included in the dataset\n",
    "- Identify how many unique SKUs are included in the dataset\n",
    "- Add a new column named 'oos' to identify out-of-stocks. If inventory on-hand > 0, then the value of this column should be 0, otherwise 1. Hint: use the lambda function\n",
    "- Create a new DataFrame computing the number of days with out-of-stocks by DC and SKU. The columns of this new DataFrame should be 'dc', 'sku', and 'oos_days'. The number of days with out-of-stocks (oos_days) should be the sum of 'oos' for each SKU at ecah DC. Hint: use groupby\n",
